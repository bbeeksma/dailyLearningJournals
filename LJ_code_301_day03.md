# Code 301, day 3

Today more jQuery.  jQuery cheat sheet at https://oscarotero.com/jquery/ is my new best friend.  Everything so far has been easy to understand.  Sometimes have to stop and think about the exact relationship between elements though when trying to find some of them, like children of siblings.

Delegating using the .on event method very useful. We could certainly have used that during our 201 final project, instead of having to build an event listener into the creation of our pop up.
