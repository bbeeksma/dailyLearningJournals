# Code 201, day 18

Today we worked on adding some of our stretch functionality to the project.  The javascript for some of this is getting quite interesting.  Figuring out the which rooms to 'light up' by filter isn't so bad, but then filtering the available selections based on what you selected in the first filter, and by what items of the second filter you have checked is a bit more complex.  Spent quite a bit of the afternoon working together with dustin on this.

I was able to get all of the functions of our popup box to happen from one event listener on the whole window, that looks for a click and then clears out the popup box, and if you clicked on a room builds a new one.  

We made sure we were rebasing our branches today as we were merging branches throughout the day.  Kept us from ending up overwriting our changes like we did a couple days ago.
