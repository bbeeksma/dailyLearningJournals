# Code 201, day 16

I feel like we made decent progress setting up our project to be successful today.  We definitely need to make sure we stay focused on the actual room picker page, to make sure we have time to complete it.  If all goes well the team should be able to fit the pieces we are working on tonight together tomorrow AM and have the page functioning, though without any graphical representation of the hotel.  We'll see if we can keep to such a tight schedule.
