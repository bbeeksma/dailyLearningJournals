# Code 201, day 18

Significantly more progress today then yesterday.  I think we had better distribution of tasks, so we were more productive. Either that or we could all see things taking shape so we had a better idea of where what we were working on fit into the whole.

Figured out that putting svg "inline" into the html was very simple, and also very easy to manipulate the svg elements with javascript.  

We had some git issues, learned how to revert changes to a specific file after a branch had been merged, and also to watch better when we are looking at the pull requests together.
