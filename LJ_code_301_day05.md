# Code 301, day 5

Today we did a workshop in class to create a form, use it to build a preview article and create a JSON string to be able to copy into our data file.

I thought it went fairly smoothly, we got done with plenty of time left. Nothing strictly new was introduced (other than the libraries we haven't used) but we put them together in different ways. I suppose the conditional operator was new for a lot of the class. Adding hightlight was an adventure, no one had used it before and there are a more different pieces that need to be put together than the other libraries we had used.
