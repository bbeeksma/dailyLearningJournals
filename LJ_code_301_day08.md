# Code 301, day 8

### Databases
  - CRUD = create, read, update, delete.  
  - persistance -- way to store data, typically on server, can also be in browser(we've done this with local storage already)
  - database = organized collection of data.  DBMS = database management system.
  - relational database = set of tables with relationships. document databases don't have the relationships so hard to do ad-hoc reporting.

### SQL
  - structured query language - standardized.  use to do CRUD
  - Statement is how you interact with the data. A statement has clauses, clauses have predicates & expressions.
    * Query is a statement that retrieves data. SELECT
  - DDL = Data definition language.  Lets us change the definition of data, manage table/index structure.
    * CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE

### Relationship to MVC
  - Models are description of a real world object.  Database table is a simple model
  - Models can also have behavior.

Hopefully this should be an easy couple of days for me.
