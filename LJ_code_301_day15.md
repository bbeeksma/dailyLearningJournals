# Code 301, day 15

### Review
Lots of review today.  There weren't any subjects that we reviewed that I felt uncomfortable with.  I want to adjust my thinking a little bit to use some of the less familiar things first.  Reach for the easy tool first instead of doing something the long way and refactoring after.
