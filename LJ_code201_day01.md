# Code 201, day 1

Today we covered some basic html.  Fairly straightforward.  Learned about connecting the css file and the Javascript file to the html file.

Also covered some basic CSS.  I understand the basic structure, and how the priority for inheriting styles work.  Going to need a lot more time playing around with it to actually understand what the stuff I type translates to visually.

Also covered some basic Javascript, logic so far is similar to things I already know. (no GOTO though).  Syntax going to take much practice.

Going over code today I learned that you can set a variable = the result of a prompt OR soemthing else, which helped account for NULL results in my code that we looked at.
