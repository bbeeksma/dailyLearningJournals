# Code 201, day 20

Today we gave our presentations on our projects.  A couple of very different speaking styles in our group.  I like off the cuff, have a lose roadmap and go speaking, Dustin likes very structured, speech completely written out, Chuck a mix of the two.  Even with such different styles I think we were able to give a fairly good presentation.  We could have had better transitions between speakers, but no big flops.

I think we did quite well on our project given the time restraints.  We demonstrated our idea, and it worked quite well.  Chuck did a great job on the responsive design portion.  Burned the midnight oil and went from "it kinda flexes" to "here is a layout on desktop, here is a layout on tablet, and here is a layout on a smartphone".  

Excited to step away from homework for a while.
