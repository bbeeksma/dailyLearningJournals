### Local Storage
Local storage is one way to save information on the client. Its not something to worry about for now, but its a good practice to check if local storage is available.  

You can set up event listeners for storage.  

HTML5 Storage is based on named key/value pairs, but everything is stored as strings.  Make sure that you handle.  ParseInt etc. might be useful.  Objects very interesting.   there is a JSON.stringify that can build your objects into strings. JSON.parse is the opposite of stringify, i.e. get an object from a string. Arrays also interesting because you can't push/slice/splice etc. need to pull out to manipulate.  Makes sense since arrays are just objects anyhow.
