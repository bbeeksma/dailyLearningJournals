# Code 201, day 3

Javascript control flow:
if, if/else - really simple
for loop, while loop, do while - while loop makes more sense to me.
switch - makes a lot of sense. functionally similar to case/when

CSS Box model
This all makes sense.  You just pick a porperty and give it to whatever element you have targeted in css.
Need to watch for widths and padding/borders changing the widths.
