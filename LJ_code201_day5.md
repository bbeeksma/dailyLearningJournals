# Code 201, day 5

Today we looked at adding images to pages in html, and rehashed some of the ways you can manipulate them with CSS.  We also learned a little bit about creative commons and making sure you only use images you won't get in trouble for using.  Saw some different ways an image would behave depending on how you align it, and learned some of the differences in image file formats.  .jpg .pnj .gif .svg.

Learned about git pull (make sure you are in the master branch), re-touched on navigating between branches, and looked more in depth at what exactly happens when you have multiple branches, and when you merge branches.
