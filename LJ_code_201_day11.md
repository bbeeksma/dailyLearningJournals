### Img Rollovers

Use CSS Selector (in class we used :hover).  Can use a different element if you want.  Transition is a very very basic way to do css animations.  If you put transition in the selector only happens when the selector is active.  If you put it on the sections affected it will work when it switches to whatever the selector is doing, and when it switches back.
