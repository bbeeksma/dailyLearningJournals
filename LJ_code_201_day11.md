### Img Rollovers

Use CSS Selector (in class we used :hover).  Can use a different element if you want.  Transition is a very very basic way to do css animations.  If you put transition in the selector only happens when the selector is active.  If you put it on the sections affected it will work when it switches to whatever the selector is doing, and when it switches back.

### Audio/video


Audio: mp3, ogg, wav formats.  
`<audio src = "sourceFile" type = "audio/ogg" conrols = "stuff"/>`
can also add autoplay, other options.  

video: mp4, ogg, webM formats.
`<video src = "sourcefile" type = "audio/ogg"/>`
Lots of attributes: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video

### Seo

SEO = Search engine optimization.  Optimize content so google finds/likes your page.  Webcrawlers look through page with html OFF. Quality, Original, and well layed out markup scores highly for SEO.  Semantic html good for this because it indicates what each content means to your page or how important that text is.
