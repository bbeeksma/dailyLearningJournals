# Code 201, day 6

domain modeling -- create a model of a problem.  lay out all the pieces you need to constuct the objects methods and functions you need to solve.

objects, literal notation

```
var objectName{
  property: value
  ,method: function(){
    some stuff happens here
  }
}
```

document object model -- a way for javascript to interact with elements on the page.  elements kind of like a family tree. can create, remove, change attributes of elements.   need  to locate elements to interact with them.  use variables to store locations of elements so you can interact with them.
